# Springboot application for local JSON
## Environment
A basic REST based SpringBoot application based on WebFlux built with SpringBoot framework version 2.7.14 and Java 11

## Purpose
More often we need a simple JSON service that will expose REST API on top of JSON files. Thid could be a local JSON file or a remote JSON file. We'll start with a simple local JSON and eventually also build a remote based solution.

## Steps
- Add local JSON file
- Create a model class
- Load it into Service
- Expose the same over REST API
